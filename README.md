# AutomationTestingOnAbhiBus
This project automates the process of booking a bus ticket on the Abhibus website using Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber.

##The automation covers the following steps:

## Open Abhibus Website: Launches the Firefox browser, maximizes the window, and opens the Abhibus website.
## Select Origin and Destination: Automatically inputs the origin (e.g., Bangalore) and destination (e.g., Goa).
## Select Travel Date: Chooses "Tomorrow" as the travel date.
## Filter Bus Types: Applies filters for specific bus types (e.g., AC, Sleeper).
## Select Seat: Selects a specific seat on the bus.
## Select Boarding and Dropping Points: Chooses the boarding and dropping points.
## Proceed to Payment: Proceeds to the payment page, with an option to skip additional offers.

This script is written in Java and uses Cucumber for BDD (Behavior Driven Development). It is designed to automate the booking process and ensure smooth user interaction on the website.
