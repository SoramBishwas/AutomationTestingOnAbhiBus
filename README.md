# AutomationTestingOnAbhiBus
## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
### This project automates the process of booking a bus ticket on the Abhibus website using Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber.

## THE AUTOMATION COVERS THE FOLLOWING STEPS:

#### Open Abhibus Website:
 Launches the Firefox browser, maximizes the window, and opens the Abhibus website.
### Select Origin and Destination: Automatically inputs the origin (e.g., Bangalore) and destination (e.g., Goa).
### Select Travel Date: Chooses "Tomorrow" as the travel date.
### Filter Bus Types: Applies filters for specific bus types (e.g., AC, Sleeper).
### Select Seat: Selects a specific seat on the bus.
### Select Boarding and Dropping Points: Chooses the boarding and dropping points.
### Proceed to Payment: Proceeds to the payment page, with an option to skip additional offers.

## This script is written in Java and uses Cucumber for BDD (Behavior Driven Development). It is designed to automate the booking process and ensure smooth user interaction on the website.
